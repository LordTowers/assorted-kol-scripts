The primary softcore Tower killing strategy relies on a synergy of Items of the Month:

Fancypants Scarecrow: 90% blocking with swashbuckling pants (20 lbs.) or spangly mariachi pants (30 lbs.)
Crown of Thrones: even more blocking, with a Mariachi Chihuahua (50%), Spooky Pirate Skeleton (30%), etc.
Greatest American Pants: Activate the Super Skill effect prior to the Tower monster fight.
Juju Mojo Mask: Activate the Gaze of the Trickster God prior to the Tower monster fight (e.g. on previous Tower monster, or a BRICKO ooze).
Rogue Program: Bring a few finger cuffs. (Other multi-round stunning items may be substituted.)
On round 1, cast Entangling Noodles. On round 2, activate Wrath of the Trickster God, which will do most of the damage. Starting on round 3, unless this is the last Tower monster you need to kill, you must reactivate the Gaze of the Trickster God for the next Tower monster. Do this by slinging a finger cuffs and spectre sceptre on round 3, and then a seal tooth and spectre sceptre each subsequent round, until the Gaze has been reactivated. The more times you do this in a day, the longer it will take.

Keep watch for messages that your finger cuffs have been destroyed, and use another if necessary. With net 95% blocking from familiar and hat, it's unlikely you'll need more than 1 or 2.

Once the Gaze has been reactivated, and as long as the monster remains cuffed and entangled, fire your biggest spell every round to augment the Trickster damage. If you have a 120 MP spell such as Eggsplosion, use that; otherwise use Saucegeyser or Fearful Fettucini or Weapon of the Pastalord or any other large spell. The Super Skill effect will reduce the cost to 0 MP.

The video game hot dog unlocker comes from the Jackass Plumber coin slot in the Game Grid Arcade. You can check it once per day; this costs no turns. The Arcade must be unlocked by clicking the wrong side of the tracks while you have a Game Grid token or ticket in your inventory.

The unlocker in the Haunted Bedroom comes from a new choice that is added to the WOODEN nightstand noncombat adventure. On any given day, a given character account will either have the new choice or not. If you see the NC and it doesn't have the new choice, you can stop looking there.

The unlocker in the eXtreme Slope comes from a new choice that is added to the Duffel Bag noncombat adventure. Same deal as the wooden nightstand -- if it's not there, stop looking.

The unlocker in the Defiled Nook (northwest corner, the +item one) works the same way. Either you get a new choice in the NC, or you don't.

The unlocker in Menagerie 1 appears to be from an ultra-rare monster, using whatever mechanisms UR monsters use.

The unlocker in Fern's Basement comes from the great great great ... grandfather ghost, with a very low drop rate. I have no idea whether +item helps or not.

The unlocker in the Haunted Conservatory is a rare drop from the skeletal cat (sniff it!). No idea whether +item helps.
The unlocker from resting probably has some ridiculously low rate of occurrence. You can get it from your daily free rests only if you don't have an Unconscious Collective familiar. If you have one of those, you can't get it from free rests; just from turn-costing rests.
The others... I don't know.

snow suit vs moveable feast
----snow suit
snow suit starts at 20lb
down by 1 every 5 combats
min of 5, after 75 combats
10% items or mp regen
3 carrots per day
total weight = 5*(15+14+13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)=600 (ignoring the constant +5 that the feast has too)

----moveable feast 
+5 to Familiar Weight
Familiar gains 1 extra experience per Adventure
Familiar will start food fights!
can feed for buff, 5 times, 10 lb for 20 turns
total weight = 1000 (but have to spread over familiars)

snow suit is probably best until it melts down to 5lb, then moveable feast is better for xp
